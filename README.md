# Medicine Recommendation System

## Project Overview
The Medicine Recommendation System predicts diseases based on a userâ€™s symptoms and recommends suitable medications, diets, precautions, and workouts. The system uses multiple machine learning models and provides an easy-to-use interface for users to input symptoms and get disease predictions with relevant recommendations.

## Features
Disease Prediction: Predicts the disease based on symptoms using trained machine learning models like Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Random Forest (RF).
Recommendations: Provides recommendations such as medications, precautions, diets, and workout plans based on the predicted disease.
Models: Includes various classifiers like Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, Naive Bayes, K-Nearest Neighbors, and Support Vector Machine.
Data Handling: Manages different data sources like symptoms, disease descriptions, medications, precautions, and more.
